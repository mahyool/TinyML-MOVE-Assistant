Audio-based motion detection using TinyML on microcontrollers

# 🎧 TinyML MOVE Assistant

This project is a motion recognition system using audio classification. It detects gestures like claps or steps using real-time audio input on microcontrollers.

## 🚀 Features
- Runs fully offline using TinyML
- Detects clap, stomp, knock gestures
- Deployed on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

## 🛠️ Tech
- TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers
- MFCCs for audio features
- Trained on custom audio dataset
